## 📝 Example of a Completed Evaluation

**Name:** Tommy Zhonghuang He  
**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Project Title:** Short Film Scene – “The Café Meeting”  
**Your intended position / actual position:** Intended: Camera Assistant / Actual: Boom Operator  

### 1. What I Learned  
On this shoot I learned how important sound is to the overall production. As the boom operator, I had to constantly adjust my position to stay out of frame while still capturing clear dialogue. I discovered how sensitive the microphone is to small noises like clothing rustle, so I practiced holding the boom more steadily. I also learned to coordinate with the camera team to anticipate actor movement.  

### 2. My Question  
How do professional boom operators balance holding the mic close enough for clear sound without risking shadows or being seen in the shot?  

### 3. Shout-Out  
I want to give a shout-out to Alex, our director of photography. He was very patient in explaining the camera’s framing to me so I could better position the boom and avoid crossing into the shot. His clear communication made my job much easier.
