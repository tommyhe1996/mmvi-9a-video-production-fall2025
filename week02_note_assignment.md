# Week 02 ‚Äì Notes & Assignment

## üé¨ Notes from *Shots ‚Äì Part 1* 

### Terminology
- **Shot**: footage recorded from hitting record to stopping. Can be a few frames or a long take (e.g., *Russian Ark, Birdman*).  
- **Sequence**: multiple shots edited together to define an action/event, build meaning and tension.  
- **Scene**: dramatic moment, multiple shots, continuous time & location. A jump in time/location = new scene.  

### Types of Shots
- **Establishing Shot** ‚Äì Introduces new scenes, tells where/when action happens. Sets POV or develops character (*Nomadland, The Martian*).  
- **Wide Shot (WS)** ‚Äì Shows character(s) in relation to environment. Can make them look small/lonely (*Parasite, Her*).  
- **Medium Shot (MS)** ‚Äì Focus on eyes while keeping physical context (*Roma, Oppenheimer*).  
- **Medium Close-Up (MCU)** ‚Äì Reduces distractions, prioritizes story detail (*All That Breathes, Past Lives*).  
- **Over the Shoulder (OTS)** ‚Äì Shot behind one actor‚Äôs shoulder to create relationship/tension (*Joker*).  
- **Close-Up (CU)** ‚Äì Strong emotion, facial expression, signals importance (*Big Eyes, Barbie*).  
- **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)** ‚Äì Greatest tool for emphasis (*Man on Fire*).  

**Guideline**: Start wide, then move closer as tension rises.  

### Rule of Thirds
- Divide frame into thirds (horizontally & vertically).  
- Place important elements at intersections for natural/captivating images.  
- Off-center composition draws the eye first.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Draft Silent Film Proposal

**Working Title**: *The Dropped Notebook*  
**Logline**: A rushing student‚Äôs dropped notebook sets off a chain of small but meaningful encounters at BCC.  
**Genre**: Drama / Slice of Life  

**Synopsis (Paragraph 1)**  
Alex, a first-year student, is late to class and juggling too many books. While running across the Atrium, he drops his notebook filled with personal sketches. The notebook contains drawings that mean the world to him. If he loses it, he risks losing not only his notes but a piece of his identity.  

**Scenario (Paragraph 2)**  
As Alex scrambles to pick up his scattered pages, another student, Maya, notices and helps. A silent exchange begins: eye contact, small smiles, and a moment of recognition. Just as Alex is about to rush off, Maya holds up one last page he missed. Their hands brush, and a quiet connection is made. Alex runs off, late but smiling. The story ends with Maya flipping through one sketch before placing it carefully on top of the pile, suggesting their paths may cross again.  

**Characters**  
- *Alex*: first-year student, shy but passionate.  
- *Maya*: fellow student, observant and kind.  

**Goal**: Alex wants to get to class without losing his belongings.  
**Tactics**: He rushes, picks things up quickly, ignores distractions.  
**Obstacles**: Time pressure, scattered papers, embarrassment.  
**Stakes**: If he fails, he risks losing his work and confidence; but if he succeeds, he gains a new unexpected connection.
