# Module 5: Screen Direction, Continuity, and Preparing for Midterm Shoots

## Overview and Objectives
This week, you'll learn and practice:
- The importance of screen direction for cohesion  
- The role of the script supervisor (scripty) and the importance of continuity in film  
- The importance of additional pre-production documents for filmmaking (overheads, script breakdowns)

## Continuity

When a director chooses to cut from one shot to another, audiences should feel like nothing has changed in terms of time, space, and everything in the frame. This is called **continuity**.  

Key elements that need to remain consistent across shots include:
- Costumes  
- Props  
- Sets and lighting  
- Actors’ performance  

### Examples of Continuity Errors
- If an actor is wearing a necklace in the long shot but forgets to put it back on for the medium close-up shot later in the day, this **breaks continuity**.  
- If the sun is overhead in a master shot, but at sunset in a close-up (creating long shadows), editing them together will **break continuity**.  

Continuity mistakes can confuse audiences or take them out of the story. Despite everyone’s best efforts, many films still have these errors—entire books and YouTube channels are dedicated to spotting them!

## Script Supervisor (Scripty)

While continuity is everyone’s responsibility on set, one role is dedicated entirely to it: the **script supervisor**, also known as the **scripty** or **continuity coordinator**.  

### Responsibilities
- Track **continuity details**: from camera settings to performance and physical details.  
- Study the **shot list** and **storyboard** before production begins.  
- Keep precise order of the shoot for the day.  
- Ensure **actors say lines as written** or agreed upon.  
- Engage during rehearsals to monitor for consistency.  
- **Time the scenes** filmed, helping directors and editors stay organized (especially in multi-camera productions).  
- Create **daily production reports**, including:  
  - What was shot  
  - What remains to be shot  
  - What was missed or skipped  

If you are detail-oriented and notice small things easily, you may be well-suited for this role.

## Sample Continuity Reports

Script supervisors use **continuity reports** to track a production. These vary in format, but all capture key information needed for editing and reshoots.

- *Script_Supervisor_Continuity_Log_2002.pdf* (sample continuity log)

## Key Takeaways
- Continuity ensures cohesion across shots and prevents distractions.  
- The script supervisor is essential to maintaining continuity and supporting both the director and editor.  
- Pre-production documents like overheads and breakdowns are critical for smooth midterm shoots.
