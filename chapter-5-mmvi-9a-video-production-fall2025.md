# Module 5: Screen Direction, Continuity, and Preparing for Midterm Shoots

## Overview and Objectives
This week, you'll learn and practice:
- The importance of screen direction for cohesion  
- The role of the script supervisor (scripty) and the importance of continuity in film  
- The importance of additional pre-production documents for filmmaking (overheads, script breakdowns)

## Continuity

When a director chooses to cut from one shot to another, audiences should feel like nothing has changed in terms of time, space, and everything in the frame. This is called **continuity**.  

### What is Continuity?
Continuity ensures that visual and audio elements in a film appear consistent and believable. It preserves the illusion that the story unfolds smoothly, even when scenes are shot out of order.

### Key Elements That Must Remain Consistent
- Costumes  
- Props  
- Sets and lighting  
- Actors’ performance and placement  
- Camera and audio levels (focus, exposure, sound quality)

### Examples of Continuity Errors
- **Subtle visual changes**: The level of a drink in a character’s glass changes between shots.  
- **Character position**: A character’s pose or orientation shifts suddenly without explanation.  
- **Wardrobe inconsistencies**: An actor’s hair, accessories, or clothing differ between takes.  
- **Lighting mismatches**: The sun is overhead in one shot, but sunset in the next.  
- **Plot continuity**: Conceptual inconsistencies in the story—such as a character contradicting earlier dialogue or established facts.  
- **Camera and audio continuity**: Changes in exposure, color temperature, sharpness, or sound recording levels.  

Continuity mistakes can confuse audiences or take them out of the story. Despite everyone’s best efforts, many films still have these errors—entire books and YouTube channels are dedicated to spotting them!

## Why Continuity Errors Happen
Continuity issues often occur because film scenes are shot out of order, sometimes weeks apart.  
They can also arise from:
- Crew fatigue and miscommunication  
- Lack of documentation or photo references  
- Improvisation by actors or crew  
- Changes in lighting conditions or camera setups  

### How to Avoid Mistakes
- Keep detailed notes and photos of each setup.  
- Use a **continuity binder or log** for wardrobe, props, and scene details.  
- Collaborate closely between camera, lighting, and sound departments.  
- Always review playback before moving on from a setup.

## Script Supervisor (Scripty)

While continuity is everyone’s responsibility on set, one role is dedicated entirely to it: the **script supervisor**, also known as the **scripty** or **continuity coordinator**.  

### Role and Importance
The script supervisor is the **link between production and post-production**, ensuring that a film can be edited together smoothly with minimal mistakes.  
As top indie scripty Tamara Hansen describes, “Script supervisors are the Google of filmmaking. If you have a question about what you shot earlier, what lens you used, or where you are emotionally in the film, you ask your script supervisor—and the answer comes back immediately.”  

### Responsibilities
- Track **continuity details**: wardrobe, props, performance, lighting, camera notes.  
- Study the **shot list** and **storyboard** before production begins.  
- Keep precise records of each take, noting usable footage and scene timing.  
- Ensure **actors say lines as written** or as approved by the director.  
- Photograph setups and maintain reference images for every shot.  
- Record **daily production reports**:
  - What was shot  
  - What remains to be shot  
  - Any missed or skipped setups  

### Script Supervisor Duties Summary
| Duty | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Continuity Tracking** | Ensures all visual and audio elements match between takes. |
| **Documentation** | Maintains logs for every camera setup, take, and line change. |
| **Director Support** | Reminds director and DP of lens choices, camera angles, and shot progression. |
| **Editor Support** | Organizes scene timings and take notes for efficient editing. |
| **Communication** | Coordinates across departments to prevent inconsistencies. |

## Sample Continuity Reports

Script supervisors use **continuity reports** to track a production. These vary in format but all capture essential information for editing and reshoots.

- The script supervisor is essential to maintaining continuity and supporting both the director and editor.  
- Pre-production documents like overheads and breakdowns are critical for smooth midterm shoots.  
- Good documentation, communication, and attention to detail are the keys to seamless storytelling.
