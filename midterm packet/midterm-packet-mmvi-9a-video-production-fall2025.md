# 🎬 MM/VI 9A – Video Production  
## Midterm Pre-Production Packet (Fall 2025)

### 📖 Overview
As you prepare to shoot your midterm project next week, you will complete a **Pre-Production Packet** that demonstrates your ability to plan, visualize, and organize a short film shoot. This packet must be **approved by your instructor** before filming begins.

The packet includes the following deliverables:

---

### 📝 1. Revised Script
- Maximum **2 pages**
- Must incorporate **feedback** from classmates and instructor  
- Ensure proper **screenplay formatting** and remove unnecessary details

---

### 🎨 2. Storyboards
- **10 – 12 drawings** (no more than 15) representing each shot in sequence  
- Each drawing = **one shot** (think of a comic strip)
- Clearly show **shot size, composition, and camera movement**
- Use simple stick figures (circle = face, full body = wide shot)  
- Indicate **movement** with arrows
- Label each panel to correspond with your shot list  

💡 *Tip:* A typical shot takes 8 – 10 minutes to film, so plan about 12 shots for a 90-minute shoot window.

---

### 🎥 3. Shot List
- Include **shot numbers** matching your storyboard labels  
- Use industry-standard abbreviations:  
  `WS` – Wide Shot  |  `MS` – Medium Shot  |  `CU` – Close-Up  |  `ECU` – Extreme Close-Up  |  `INSERT` – Detail Shot  
- Include **camera movement notes** (pan, tilt, dolly, etc.) and **location/time of day**
- Suggested template → [Google Sheets Shot List Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ZRC2DxLmWhgPQ6rbUXGTmFF9FoUaXWtSBVdpDcPcmo/edit?usp=sharing)

---

### 🧭 4. Overheads / Blocking Diagrams
Provide at least **one overhead per scene** (or more if complex).

Each overhead should show:
- **Camera placements**, labeled 1, 2, 3 …  
- **Actor positions**, shown as circles with initials (e.g., C = Chartreuse, M = Maple)
- **Arrows** for character and camera movement
- Important spatial features (doors, desks, shelves, windows)

💡 *Think of it like a sports play diagram — plan your moves before game day!*

---

### 🧩 5. Script Breakdowns
Create one per scene to identify production elements.  
Tag each of the following if applicable:
- **Cast / Characters**
- **Props & Set Dressing**
- **Costumes / Makeup**
- **Sound / Music**
- **Lighting or Special Equipment**
- **VFX / Stunts (if any)**

You may:
- Handwrite on the provided template and upload a clear photo 📷  
- OR use the downloadable [Word / Google Doc template](https://www.nfi.edu/film-script-breakdown/)

---

### ⚙️ Translating Script → Storyboard → Shot List
If a **script** tells *what happens*, the **storyboard** and **shot list** tell *how it looks*.

1. Visualize each beat of your story.
2. Sketch out frames on sticky notes or digital slides.
3. Note emotional focus — what does the viewer feel in each frame?
4. “Line” your script in the margins to match your planned shots.

💡 *Efficient shoots group similar camera angles to save setup time.*

---

### 🕒 Shooting Schedule & Efficiency
- You have **~90 minutes** to shoot.  
- Each shot = 8 – 10 minutes → Plan for ≈ 12 shots.  
- Follow **B.L.R.T.S.**:  
  **Blocking → Lighting → Rehearsal → Tweaking → Shooting**
