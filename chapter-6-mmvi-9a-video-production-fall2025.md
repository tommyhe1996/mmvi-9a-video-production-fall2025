## 🎧 Module Overview: Introduction to Sound
Sound is half of the storytelling in film. This module explored **how sound shapes emotion, tension, and realism**—covering technical setup, recording techniques, and creative sound design.

### Objectives
Over the next few weeks, you will:
- Learn how sound enhances storytelling.  
- Understand the roles and responsibilities of a sound recordist.  
- Operate field recording equipment (Zoom H4n recorder, boom mic, and audio kit).  
- Set up and record synch and non-synch sound.  
- Apply proper recording etiquette during production.

## 🎬 Lecture Summary: The Power of Sound in Storytelling
Sound helps guide emotional tone, suspense, and audience connection.

### Key Concepts
- **Sound influences emotion faster than visuals.** The brain processes sound more rapidly, shaping how we interpret scenes.  
- **Sound design begins at conception.** Consider sound cues when planning your story.  
- **Diegetic Sound:** Heard by characters (dialogue, footsteps, ambient sounds).  
- **Non-Diegetic Sound:** Heard only by the audience (score, narration, sound effects).

### Sound Production & Post Terms
| Term | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Score** | Music that contributes to tone and mood. |
| **Foley** | Studio-recorded everyday sounds (footsteps, clothing). |
| **ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement)** | Re-recording dialogue in studio for clarity or creative intent. |
| **Sound Design** | The full creative process combining score, effects, and mixing. |
| **Signal-to-Noise Ratio** | Balance between desired sound (voice) and background noise. |

## 🎤 Zoom Recorder & Audio Kit Setup

### Equipment List
- **Zoom H4n Recorder** (with SD card and AA batteries)  
- **Shotgun Mic** + Shock Mount + Boom Pole  
- **Headphones** (wired only, no Bluetooth)  
- **Y-Splitter, XLR cable, and foam windscreen ("dead cat")**

### Recorder Setup Steps
1. Insert batteries & SD card.  
2. **Turn off “Stamina Mode.”**  
3. **Factory reset** and **format SD card.**  
4. Set **recording format:** WAV, 48 kHz, 24-bit.  
5. Turn **Phantom Power ON (24V)** for mics that need power.  
6. Choose **Stereo Mode.**  
7. Connect the mic and headphones.  
8. Test-record and monitor levels between **–6 dB and –12 dB.**  
9. Back up or delete old recordings.

## 🎙️ Boom Operation & Technique

### Best Practices
- Maintain a **consistent distance** between mic and speaker’s mouth.  
- Avoid casting **boom shadows** or entering the frame.  
- Use your **body and fingertips** to smoothly adjust mic angle.  
- Work closely with camera operators for frame lines.  
- **Monitor with headphones** at all times.  
- Remove jewelry or anything that might tap the pole.  

> 💪 Tip: Boom operating is physically demanding—develop upper-body strength for steadier operation.

## 🧠 Sound Theory in Film

### How Sound Builds Suspense
- Watch *Drive* (2011) – an Oscar-winning example of tension through sound.  
- List all audible sound layers (engine, footsteps, ambient hum, dialogue, music).  
- Identify **five most crucial sound elements** that create emotional pacing.  
:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Sound’s Role in Storytelling
- **Cue audience emotions** — fear, excitement, serenity.  
- **Define time/place** — rain, traffic, or city chatter can establish location.  
- **Trigger release** — moments of silence heighten impact.  
- **Build rhythm** — align sound with cuts and camera movement.

## 🎧 Recording Levels and Room Tone
- **Dialogue levels:** around **–12 dB.**  
- **Too high:** distorted; **too low:** hiss.  
- Always record **room tone (30 seconds minimum)** at the end of every take.  
  - Captures natural ambience to “glue” edited dialogue together.  
:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 🎵 Music Usage Guidelines
- Only use **music you have rights to use.**  
- Avoid recognizable songs—they can overshadow your story.  
- **Free music sources:**  
  - [freesound.org](http://freesound.org)  
  - [mobigratis.com](http://mobigratis.com)  
  - YouTube Audio Library (only allowed for YouTube uploads).  
:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## 🎥 ASMR Video Lab Project
Create a **1–2 minute ASMR short** focusing on sound creativity.  
Use objects that make subtle, tactile sounds:
- Cracking bread crusts 🍞  
- Painting or brush textures 🎨  
- Bike gears 🚴‍♂️  
- Keyboard clicks ⌨️  

### Guidelines
- Record clean, crisp sound using your Zoom recorder.  
- Practice boom mic positioning at home.  
- Bring personal sound objects to class lab.  
- Submit edited video with synced sound.

## 🧾 Sound Report Practice
Sound reports help editors sync and organize sound files.

**Sound Report Template Fields:**  
- Project Title / Sound Mixer  
- Track Format / Recording Media  
- Scene, Take, File Name, Remarks  
- Sample Frequency, Timecode, Bit Depth  

> Keep detailed notes for each take, including ambient sounds, mic settings, and any problems.

## 🧵 Cable Management: Over-Under Method
To extend cable life and prevent tangling:
1. Loop first coil normally (over).  
2. Flip wrist for the second coil (under).  
3. Alternate “over–under” pattern until finished.  
4. Secure with velcro or tie line.

## 🎤 Framing & Recording Interviews
### Composition
- Place subject **screen left or right** following the **Rule of Thirds.**  
- Maintain eyeline near the camera lens for emotional connection.  
- Include environmental context to enhance storytelling.  
:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

### Conducting the Interview
- Write **open-ended questions** beforehand.  
- Advise subjects **not to wear stripes or busy patterns.**  
- Record in quiet space — close doors/windows.  
- Use **two framing compositions:** MCU and CU.  
- Place **Zoom recorder or boom mic** close to the subject.  

### Sample Lab Exercise
Interview a classmate:
1. Frame shot MCU.  
2. Ask to **state name or count to ten** to check levels.  
3. Ask:
   - Introduce yourself.  
   - How has your filmmaking experience evolved?  
   - What are your career aspirations?  
   - Would you recommend BCC to others?
