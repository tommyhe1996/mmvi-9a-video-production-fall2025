## Step 2: Synopsis  
In the bustling Berkeley campus lounge, a student named Alex desperately needs water after a grueling run. Sweaty and drained, his only goal is to rehydrate before class. He hurries to a glowing vending machine, knowing he’s already short on time.  

Alex tries every tactic—staring down the keypad, pressing buttons, and fumbling with contactless payment on his phone—but the machine resists. He crouches, taps, and retries, his frustration growing as the minutes slip away. Without the drink, Alex risks losing focus during his upcoming test, which could mean failing the class. The task may seem small, but the consequences loom large.

Alex presses the keypad with confidence, but nothing happens. He tries again—harder. The machine beeps but doesn’t deliver. Desperate, he waves his phone for payment until finally a clunk echoes inside. The drink falls.  

Relieved, Alex snatches the bottle, raises it in triumph, and takes a victorious sip. But before he can savor the moment, his watch buzzes—a reminder that class has already started. With panic on his face, he dashes away, drink in hand.
