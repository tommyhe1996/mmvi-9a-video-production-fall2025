## Objectives
- Learn and study types of shots and additional composition techniques.  
- Understand and practice the **180 Degree Rule**.  
- Begin learning editing, including how to use Adobe Premiere Pro.

## 180 Degree Rule
The **180 Degree Rule** is one of the most important guidelines in cinema and video production.  

- It establishes an **imaginary axis (eye line)** between two characters or between a character and an object.  
- By keeping the camera on **one side of this axis**, you preserve consistent left/right spatial relationships.  
- This maintains clarity and helps the audience follow the scene.  
- **Crossing the line** (placing the camera on the opposite side of the axis) can create a disorienting or distracting effect, unless used deliberately for storytelling impact.
