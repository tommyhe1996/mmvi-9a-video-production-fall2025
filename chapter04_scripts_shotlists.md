### Shot Lists: A Filmmaker's Key to Organization
In addition to storyboards, your shot list is a key pre-production deliverable. Shot lists are like the blueprint for your film, mapping out everything that will happen in a scene by describing each shot.

**What to Include in Shot Lists:**
- **Scene and Shot:** Example: 1A, 1B, 1C
- **Camera Placement:** Camera positions or set-ups, referenced alongside overhead diagrams (covered next week).
- **Size:** WS, MS, CU, ECU (Wide, Medium Shot, Close Up, Extreme Close Up)
- **Framing/Angle:** POV, Single, Two-Shot, Low Angle, Bird’s Eye
- **Movement:** Pan, Tilt, etc.
- **Subject:** Character name or object
- **Description of Action:** What happens in the shot

**Tip:** Storyboards and shot lists should use the same labels for scenes and shots, so the crew can follow both documents easily.

### Why Formatting is Important
- A well-formatted script shows professionalism and confidence.
- Proper formatting is visually clear and uncluttered, appealing to readers.
- Standard formatting ensures **1 page ≈ 1 minute of screen time**, helping estimate running time, shoot schedules, and costs.

### Screenplay: The Expression of Film
The screenplay is the expression of the story, characters, actions, locations, and tone of your film, written in a specialized format.

**Why Format Matters:**
- Think of it as a checklist, a blueprint for collaboration.
- Ensures the entire crew is on the same page.
- Typically created alongside the shot list.

### Screenplay Examples
Recommended scripts to study:
- *The Last Black Man in San Francisco*
- *Hustlers*
- *Crazy Rich Asians*

**Tips for Writing:**
- **Show, Don’t Tell:** Write only what can be seen on screen.
- **Focus on Behavior:** Actions reveal character intentions and tone.
- **Use Images, Not Shot Names:** Don’t insert camera angles into your script; save those for your shot list.
- **Be Ready to Rewrite:** Scripts evolve through multiple drafts.

### Anatomy of a Script Page
Key formatting rules:
- Capitalize names of main characters when first introduced.
- Capitalize props or sounds that carry major narrative weight.
- Use Celtx or WriterDuet for correct formatting.

**Note:** Do **not** use Microsoft Word or Google Docs for scripts in this class.
